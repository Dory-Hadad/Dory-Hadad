# Cool projets I'm working on

### Geodar's Explor 1.5 (soon 2.0 😄)  
My contributions:
- Parts of the firmware  
- Parts of the PI to ESP32 programming (and vice-versa)  
### Automated plant watering system
- Still in the works!
- Using a Xiao RP2040
- Have to figure out a water pump
### Matlab scripts for signal and image deconstruction and filtering
- Fourier, Radon, discretization and Laplace transform
- Especially leaning towards medical imagery: CT-scanning and mammography
### Simulink (Matlab) for circuit simulation
- P, PI, PID, feed-forward controllers (and others!) 
- Servo systems and optimizing response time
