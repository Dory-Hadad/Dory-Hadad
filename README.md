# Hey, I’m @Dory-Hadad 👋
I’m an ⚡**electrical**💡 engineer  
I mostly do firmware and microcontroller-related programs  
I now believe I use git correctly (don't look at my commit messages)    
Here is my work email :
- dory@geodar.ca

# Cool projets I'm working on

### Geodar's Explor 2.0 😄 (soon in your local stores?)  
My contributions:
- Firmware using Rust 🦀  
- Raspi CM4 with Ubuntu / RP2040   
### Automated plant watering system
- Still in the works!
- Using old vape batteries, recharged by solar
- Using a Xiao RP2040
- Have to figure out a water pump
### Matlab scripts for signal and image deconstruction and filtering
- Fourier, Radon, discretization and Laplace transform
- Especially leaning towards medical imagery: CT-scanning and mammography
### Simulink (Matlab) for circuit simulation
- P, PI, PID, feed-forward controllers (and others!) 
- Servo systems and optimizing response time
